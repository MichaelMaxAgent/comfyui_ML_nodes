# ComfyUI Image Saver & Frame Rate Processor Requirements
#
# Note: PyTorch and NumPy are already included with ComfyUI installation
# These are minimal additional requirements

# Image processing
Pillow>=9.0.0

# Note: ffmpeg is required for video processing and frame rate resampling
# but it's a system-level dependency, not a Python package.
# Install ffmpeg using your system package manager:
#
# Ubuntu/Debian:  sudo apt install ffmpeg
# macOS:          brew install ffmpeg
# Windows:        Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
#
# Verify installation with: ffmpeg -version
